  <p>MedTimeLog helps you track your med usage and the medication usage of those that you care for.</p>
  <p>MedTimeLog can help caregivers easily share today's realtime medication delivery status.</p>
  <p>Because giving our <em>inherited</em> glaucoma cat needed 6 drops of 3 medications each day was too complicated to share with ease, I created this App to keep us coordinated.</p>
